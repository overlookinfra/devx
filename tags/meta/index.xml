&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Puppet Content Templates (PCT) codify a structure to produce content for any Puppet Product that can be authored by Puppet Product Teams or external users without direct help of the PDK team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PCT can create any type of a Puppet Product project: Puppet control repo, Puppet Module, Bolt project, etc. It can create one or more independent files, such as CI files or gitignores. This can be as simple as a name for a Puppet Class, a set of CI files to add to a Puppet Module, or as complex as a complete Puppet Control repo with roles and profiles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are meant to be ready-to-run, which means they put everything needed for a user to run the project from the moment after creation. This solves the &amp;lsquo;blank page&amp;rsquo; problem, where a few files are in place but the user does not know what the next steps are.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong>
PCT is currently in an EXPERIMENTAL phase and feedback is encouraged via &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/discussions">pdkgo/discussions&lt;/a> and starting a &lt;code>feedback&lt;/code> post.&lt;/p>
